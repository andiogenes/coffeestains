# coffeestains
As of June 26, 2021, the current version of this package is 0.5.2

This package provides an essential feature to LaTeX that has been missing for too long. It adds a coffee stain to your documents. A lot of time can be saved by printing stains directly on the page rather than adding it manually.

As we do not believe in imaginary property, this package belongs to the public domain.

This package is originally written by Hanno Rein <hanno (-at-) hanno-rein.de>
It is now maintained by Patrick Bideault <pb-latex@gmx.fr>.
